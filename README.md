# Blockchain - A Blockchain and Miner Application

This project is a blockchain and miner application developed using Node.js. This application provides a fundamental example to understand the concepts of blockchain and miners.


## Features

- Simple blockchain structure.
- Mining process with miners.
- Real-time data communication using Socket.io.

## Getting Started

You can follow the steps below to run the project on your local machine:
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Yesarib/Blockchainn.git

2. **Install Required Packages:**
    After cloning the project, open 2 console and navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:
   ```sh
   cd Blockchain
   npm install
   ```
   ```sh
   cd Miner
   npm install

3. **Run the Application:**
    Once you have installed the required packages, start the application using the following command on both console:
   ```sh
   nodemon start
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
    The application will run by default on http://localhost:3000 (for MongoDB connection).
    
    For socket connection, you can use http://localhost:8000.

   
## Blockchain Section
In the blockchain section, you can share fundamental information about the blockchain. You can explain how the blockchain works, how it's created, and how data is stored. 

## Miner Section
In the miner section, you can provide details about miners. Explain how miners attempt to mine blocks, how newly mined blocks are sent to the blockchain section using sockets, and how validation and broadcasting are performed.
